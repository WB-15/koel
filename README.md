## Supporting Vue.js

Koel is built on [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/), the ongoing development of which is made possible thanks to the support by these awesome [backers](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/backers.md). If you'd like to join them, check out [Vue.js' Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/evanyou).

## Intro

**Koel** (also styled as **koel**, with a lowercase k) is a simple web-based personal audio streaming service written in [Vue](http://vuejs.org/) at the client side and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) on server side. Targeting web developers, Koel embraces some of the more modern web technologies – flexbox, audio, and drag-and-drop API to name a few – to do its job.
